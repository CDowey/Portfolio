## Public Web Applications
- [The Vermont Natural Resources Atlas](https://anrmaps.vermont.gov/websites/anra5/) - The primary source for geospatial information in Vermont. Our teams maintains this application and the associated web services, data, and databases. An essential tool in the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources achieving its mission.

- [Vermont Big Trees](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/7637f5256b65454aa123e0c631f1f46a/page/Map/) - An ArcGIS Experience builder application (platform was required by the project) that shows Vermont's Champion Trees. The data is dynamic and reflects the most up to date observations collected by Vermont Foresters and partners in the field.

- [Vermont Planning Atlas Rental Assistance Eligibility](https://maps.vermont.gov/ACCD/Html5Viewer/index.html?viewer=PlanningAtlas&layerTheme=rental%20assistance%20eligibility&runWorkflow=Rental%20Assistance%20Eligibility) - An extension on the Vermont Planning Atlas which allows low-income renters determine if the automatically qualify for rental assistance programs. This extension uses url parameters and a behind the scenes workflow to geocode the submitted address, intersect the result with Housing and Urban Development's Low-Moderate Income spatial data and provide the user with an almost immediate answer.

## Internal Web Applications
- **Vermont Historic Sites Maintenance Center** - This is an internal application but I can share a screenshot below. This is a React web application that provides Historic Sites Staff with real-time information about their assets. We are working on a similar system and interface for tree health monitoring.

## Geoprocessing + Visualization
- [Mount Mansfield State Forest Landslide](https://github.com/CDowey/CottonBrookLandslide) - When the largest landslide in the last 100 years occurred in Mount Mansfield State Forest I worked with the Vermont Transportation UAV team to fly the area in the days after to assess the damage and get volume and area estimates. In order to share our data in a light and fast package that required no software other than a browser. I created this [visualization](https://cdowey.github.io/CottonBrookLandslide/) in python.

- [Vermont Fall Foliage Tracker](https://accd.maps.arcgis.com/apps/TimeAware/index.html?appid=c6067d30fae846a18522fec0bcc75d1e) - A time-enabled web map that shows the average progression of Vermont's Fall Foliage from 2005-2015. The foliage stages were mapped by analyzing a decade of satellite imagery for color change patterns.
